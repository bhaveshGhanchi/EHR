# eHealthRecords | EHR (Electronic Health record System)

## Project Description

### Problem Statement:

The majority of healthcare software solutions in India are Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems, which often lack the comprehensive capabilities of Electronic Health Records (EHR). EHRs offer significant advantages in terms of accessibility, quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. This project aims to develop a robust EHR software to address these shortcomings and provide a more advanced healthcare solution.

### Objectives:

- Implement a robust web application for maintaining electronic health records.
- Improve quality, safety, and efficiency of healthcare delivery through EHR.
- Enhance care coordination among physicians and healthcare practitioners.
- Convert handwritten clinical notes into structured text/data for easier analysis.
- Perform clinical text mining and analysis on the structured data to extract valuable insights.
- Develop a user-friendly UI/dashboard for visualizing patient health data.
- Train a handwriting recognition model using Kaggle datasets to improve accuracy in converting handwritten notes.
Scope:

**The application will include the following key components:** 

1. Admin:
  - Patient details and records
  - Billing information
2. Radiology:
  - Patient tracking
  - Scheduling
  - Result reporting
  - Image tracking
3. Clinical:
  - Clinical documents containing information related to patient care and services
4. Laboratory:
  - Structured data storage and management
  - Standard terminology usage
5. Pharmacy:
  - Inventory management
  - Prescription management
  - Billing
  - Dispensing medications
6. Visualization:
  - Dashboard for visualizing patient health data
7. AI/ML:
  - Handwriting recognition model training
  - Clinical text mining and analysis

<br/>
By addressing these components, the eHealthRecords application will provide a comprehensive and efficient solution for healthcare providers and patients.
